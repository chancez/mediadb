cs275_mediadb
=============

This is a rewrite of a project I did for my OSU CS275 class (databases) that was done in PHP.

It is written in Python using Flask, and MySQL.

Set up  is simple, you install the required packages

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure mysql is running and credentials in the code are correct, and you
should be ready to run.
